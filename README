PDP10-TOOLS
===========

pdp10-tools is a collection of utilities for pdp10-elf.

ar:		archiver for pdp10-elf object files
as:		assembler producing pdp10-elf object files
		intended primarily as an assembler for GCC output;
		the syntax is modelled after normal UNIX/ELF syntax
		rather than classic TOPS-10, TOPS-20, or ITS syntax
ld:		linker for pdp10-elf object files
nm:		list symbols from pdp10-elf object files
od:		file dumper for binary files with 9-bit bytes (nonets)
readelf:	display information about pdp10-elf object files,
		extended with an option to disassemble .text sections
sim:            a simulator for running pdp10-elf executables on a
                hypothetical fully-extended PDP10 called the KE10
8to9:		a utility to convert octet files to nonet files and back

Support libraries include:

archive:	reading and writing archives containing pdp10-elf object files
pdp10_elf36:	reading and writing pdp10-elf (aka Elf36) object files
pdp10_stdio:	reading and writing nonet-based files on an octet-based host

See the TODO file for known omissions and planned improvements.
