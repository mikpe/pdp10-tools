PDP10-TOOLS
===========

pdp10-tools is a collection of utilities for pdp10-elf.

ar:		an 'ar' clone for pdp10-elf object files
as:		a pdp10 assembler producing pdp10-elf object files
		intended primarily as an assembler for GCC output;
		the syntax is modelled after normal UNIX/ELF syntax
		rather than classic TOPS-10, TOPS-20, or ITS syntax
nm:		an 'nm' clone for pdp10-elf object files
od:		an 'od' clone for binary files with 9-bit bytes (nonets)
readelf:	a 'readelf' clone for pdp10-elf object files,
		extended with an option to disassemble .text sections
sim:            a simulator for running pdp10-elf executables on a
                hypothetical fully-extended PDP10 called the KE10
8to9:		a utility to convert octet files to nonet files

pdp10-stdio:	a library for reading and writing nonet-based data
		on an octet-based host
pdp10-elf36:	a library for reading and writing Elf36 object files


See the TODO file for known omissions and planned improvements.
