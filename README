PDP10-TOOLS
===========

pdp10-tools is a collection of utilities for pdp10-elf:

elf2boot:	converts PDP-10 ELF-36 and ELF-64 executables to KLH10-bootable files
libelf:		reading and writing ELF-32, ELF-36, and ELF-64 object files
sim:            a simulator for running PDP-10 ELF-36 executables on a
                hypothetical fully-extended PDP10 called the KE10
stdio9:		reading and writing nonet-based files on an octet-based host

The following components were developed for the PDP-10 ELF-36 project
and are now deprecated given the PDP-10 ELF-64 support in GNU binutils:

ar:		archiver for pdp10-elf object files
archive:	reading and writing archives containing pdp10-elf object files
as:		assembler producing pdp10-elf object files
		intended primarily as an assembler for GCC output;
		the syntax is modelled after normal UNIX/ELF syntax
		rather than classic TOPS-10, TOPS-20, or ITS syntax
ld:		linker for pdp10-elf object files
nm:		list symbols from pdp10-elf object files
od:		file dumper for binary files with 9-bit bytes (nonets)
ranlib:		add an index to a pdp10-elf archive (same as `ar s`)
readelf:	display information about pdp10-elf object files,
		extended with an option to disassemble .text sections
8to9:		a utility to convert octet files to nonet files and back

See the TODO file for known omissions and planned improvements.
