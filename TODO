Elf36 Specification:

- Do we want to adjust SHN_LORESERVE up to SHN_HIRESERVE, including SHN_XINDEX, to
  account for the fact that we have 2 more bits available in Elf36_Half?
  I'm inclined not to change, but to allow indices in [SHN_HIRESERVE+1,PDP10_UINT18_MAX]
  as-is without going through SHN_XINDEX.

- Same question for PN_XNUM?

- Summarize the differences between Elf32 and Elf36 in a document somewhere.

Tools:

- top-level Makefile: subdirs should error out on error in subdir
- size: implement it
- strip: implement it
- ranlib: add wrapper script doing 'ar s'
- sim: improve it so it can run simple applications
- as/ld: add support for PIC
- as/ld: add support for shared objects
