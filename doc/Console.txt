PDP10 Console I/O
=================

PDP6 / KA10
-----------

The console is a Teletype Model KSR 33, 35, or 37.
Transfer speed is 10 (Model 33, 35) or 15 (Model 37) characters per second.
Signalling uses one start bit, eight data bits, and two stop bits per character.
Character codes are 8-bit with the high bit being even parity -- some models
require correct parity even for output.
The character set is 7-bit ASCII, but the Model 35 converts lower case letters to
upper case on printing.  The Model 33 does not support lower case letters.
The internal device code is 0120, aka TTY.

A CONO is needed to assign a priority interrupt level to the device.

Output: DATAO TTY, places data in output buffer, sets Output Busy and starts transmitter.
Completion of transmission clears Output Busy, Sets Output Done, and requests an interrupt.

Input: At start of input transmission Input Busy is set, at completion Input Busy is cleared
and Input Done is set, and an interrupt is requested.  A DATAI then reads the character
and clears Input Done.

Sending a TAB requires sending a rubout (DEL) and waiting for completion.

KI10
----

[TBD, but believed to be similar to PDP6 and KA10]

KL10
----

From one to four PDP11-compatible interface processors (DTE20s) for low-speed I/O.
Device code 0120 dropped, must use DTE20 for console.

A PDP11-owned communication region is defined by the EPTDPW word in the EPT, and is written to
by the PDP11 and read from by the PDP10.

A PDP10-owned communication region is defined by PDP10 software, and is written to
by the PDP10 and read from by the PDP11.

A restricted front end can only read from a PDP10-owned communication region, and can only
write to a PDP11-owned communication region.

The console hangs off a DL11 interface on the PDP11 UNIBUS.

[Most details TBD.  Need to check in monitor sources.]

Dolphin / KXF10
---------------

PDP-11/34A based (Toby SBC with Fonz-11 chipset) console microprocessor with a VT100.

[No more details known at this time.]

KS10 / KD10
-----------

The console is an LA36 terminal and is handled by an 8080 microprocessor attached to the KS10 bus.

See module SCNSER in the TOPS-10 monitor sources.

A character typed on the console is deposited by the 8080 into KS10 physical memory location 32,
and then an APR interrupt with the 8080 as source is generated.

A character sent to the console is deposited by the KS10 into KS10 physical memory location 33,
and then the 8080 is interrupted.  The 8080 reads the character, clears location 33, and interrupts
the KS10.

Jupiter / KC10
--------------

[TBD]

XKL-1 TOAD-1
------------

The console is an RS-232 serial port connected directly to the XKL-1 processor and handled
directly by the XKL-1 processor's microcode.

Use RDCTY and WRCTY instructions for reading from or writing to the console.
Use WRCTYS and RDCTYS instructions for writing or reading console status and control.

I/O is by a single character at a time.  Both input and output can be interrupt-driven.
