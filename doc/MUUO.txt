	 * LUUOs:
	 * 001-037
	 *
	 * MUUOs:
	 * TOPS-20:		104(JSYS); 040-051 and 055-077 in section 0
	 * TOPS-10 except KA10:	040-051, 055-077
	 * KA10:		040-051, 055-100
	 * KC10/KD10:		040-101, 104(JSYS), 130, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 247
	 * XKL-1:		040-101, 104(JSYS), 247
	 *
	 * Unassigned codes are not MUUOs, but the processor reacts to them in the same way.
	 *
	 * 042-046 are reserved MUUOs.
	 * 052-054, 101 are unassigned on <= KL10, MUUOs on KC10/KD10/XKL-1.
	 *
	 * The kernel-mode target of a MUUO is a function of the context in which the MUUO
	 * was executed (or the overflow trap occurred), but the opcode of the MUUO is not
	 * a parameter of that function. (<= KL10, XKL-1).
	 *
	 * KA10: 247 and 257 are unassigned but act as NOPs not MUUOs unless special hardware is present.
	 *
	 * KC10: MUUOs are first classified into one of six classes (VM traps, unassigned user-mode
	 * opcodes, unassigned I/O opcodes, unassigned EXTEND opcodes, JSYS, other MUUOs), then
	 * dispatched via a six-entry vector.
	 *
	 * KD10: Like KC10, except the VM traps case does not exist.
